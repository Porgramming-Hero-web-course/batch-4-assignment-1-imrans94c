***The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.***
In TypeScript union and intersection types are very effective. it is help to ensure type and more safety in code.Union types allow a variable to be one of several possible types,denoted by the "|" symbol. It is allow us to create complex types are Union and Intersection types. These types provide us with the ability to create new types from existing ones, leading to more flexible and reusable code. 

Union Types : Union types are a way of declaring a type that could be one of several types. We use the vertical bar (|) to separate each type.

Here's an example of a function that uses a union type:

function padLeft(value: string, padding: string | number) {}

In this function, the padding parameter can be either a string or a number. This is a simple yet powerful way to handle multiple types in a single function.

Intersection Types:
Intersection types are another powerful feature in TypeScript. They allow you to combine multiple types into one, resulting in a type that has all the properties of the combined types

Here's an example of intersection types:

interface ErrorHandling {
  success: boolean;
  error?: { message: string };
}

interface ArtworksData {
  artworks: { title: string }[];
}

type ArtworksResponse = ArtworksData & ErrorHandling;

Here, ArtworksResponse is an intersection type that combines ArtworksData and ErrorHandling. An object of type ArtworksResponse will have all the properties of ArtworksData and ErrorHandling.
